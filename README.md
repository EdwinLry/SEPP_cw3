## ðŸš« Do Not Push Directly to `main`

Please **do not push any code directly into the `main` branch**.


### âœ… Workflow

- Create or use your personal branch (e.g., `dev1`, `dev2`, etc.)
- Work on your feature and commit changes there
- Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch into `main`
- **Review your code and make sure there are no errors** and merge into main

This keeps the `main` branch stable and avoids accidental bugs or conflicts. :)
